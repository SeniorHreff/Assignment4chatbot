In this assignment we've implemented a NLP pipeline using the LangChain library and Hugging Face Transformers. Initially, we set up a Question-Answering (QA) system employing a RetrievalQA chain with a predefined template. This system utilized a language model (llm) and a document vector store (Chroma) for efficient retrieval and processing. We then demonstrated the system's capability by answering questions related to rules and rights for the staff.

Additionally, we integrated text splitting to handle large documents efficiently and embedded the text content using a pre-trained language model.

Furthermore, we performed similarity search to find relevant information based on user queries. Finally, we summarized the results and presented them with proper text wrapping for readability. The overall system allows for querying, retrieval, and summarization of information.
